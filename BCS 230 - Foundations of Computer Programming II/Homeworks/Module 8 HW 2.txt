Professor Brailsford cannot live without pointers because they allow you to create linked lists. A linked list is a long string of objects tied to each other. Professor Brailsford uses the exmaple of a shopping list for a cookout to represent this. You have your items organized in a specific way and in order to add items you cannot simply erase every item below where you would like it and so you must organize your list with pointers so as to add new items and not have to derefence ones further down in the list.
